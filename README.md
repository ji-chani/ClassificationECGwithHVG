## **Abstract:**

Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are used in medicine to identify signs of cardiovascular diseases of
a patient. This is done by observing and identifying possible abnormalities in the time series signal.
Machine learning tools has been utilized to aid this classification problem, that is classifying normal
and abnormal ECG signals. But with the introduction of Visibility Algorithm which converts time
series data into a complex network, different approaches were developed to solve the classification
problem. This paper presents a simple approach to perform ECG signal classification by utilizing
graph properties obtained from visibility graphs corresponding to the signals. 
The classification is done using Logistic Regression which resulted with a promising overall accuracy of 96.9%.
